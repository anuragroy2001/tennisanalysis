##  Overview

This tennis analysis system uses state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automatically analyze tennis match footage. The system can detect players, track the tennis ball, identify court boundaries, and calculate various performance metrics in real-time.

## Features

- **Player Detection & Tracking**: Automatically detects and tracks tennis players throughout the match
- **Ball Tracking**: Real-time tennis ball detection and trajectory analysis
- **Court Keypoint Detection**: Identifies and maps tennis court boundaries and key areas
- **Speed Calculation**: Measures player movement speed and ball velocity
- **Shot Analysis**: Counts shots and analyzes shot patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Generates comprehensive statistics and insights
- **Visual Analytics**: Creates visualizations and mini-court representations

## Technology Stack

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch/TensorFlow
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Object Detection**: YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **Neural Networks**: CNNs for keypoint detection
- **Tracking Algorithms**: Advanced object tracking methods
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn


The system provides comprehensive analysis including:

- **Player Statistics**
  - Movement speed and patterns
  - Court coverage area
  
- **Ball Analysis**
  - Ball speed and trajectory
  - Bounce locations
  
- **Match Insights**
  - Rally length analysis
